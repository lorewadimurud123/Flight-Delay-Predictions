# Flight Delay Predictions

This code is created for practice. Different models are used and their performance is compared in terms of auc score.

# Data

For this project data is taken from kaggle compitition - **2015 Flight Delays and Cancellations** and link is provided below.

# Models

Different models are trained and used to predict the delays. Performance of different models is measured in terms of roc_auc_score(). All the models are trained with their default parameters to maintain the simplicity of code. The models used are:

DecisionTreeClassifier

XGBoost

LightGBM

CatBoost
